The datasets are from Kaggle. The question is about predicting the monthly sales of camping gear in a store for an entire year. This is an important task because accurate forecasting can help businesses make better decisions and avoid potential losses. Although it may seem like a daunting task, it can be done using a combination of scientific methods and historical data.

In this challenge, participants are encouraged to use both traditional forecasting techniques and machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of their predictions. Accurate sales forecasting is critical for businesses to optimize their operations and achieve their goals.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an important step in understanding and gaining insights from data. In this case, we are analyzing data from the same stores located in three different states: California, Texas, and Wisconsin. To perform EDA on this data, we need to preprocess the data and visualize it in a way that makes it easy for readers to understand its composition.

The preprocessing step may involve cleaning and transforming the data, such as handling missing values or converting categorical variables into numerical values. Once the data is preprocessed, we can then create various types of visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, to better understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between variables.

By visualizing the data, we can gain insights into trends, patterns, and outliers that may not be apparent from simply looking at the raw data. This can help us make better decisions and identify areas for further analysis or improvement.

Overall, performing EDA on the data from the same stores in different states can provide valuable insights into how the stores are performing in different regions and can help identify areas for improvement or optimization.

Using LSTM for prediction, we can forecast the sales data for the next 28 days. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that can capture the long-term dependencies in time series data and make accurate predictions based on previous patterns and trends.
